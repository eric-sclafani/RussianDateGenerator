# Russian Date Generator

Linguistics Report:
  Russian dates work a little differently than English dates. First, the day, month and year are not separated by "/" but rather with ".". In Russian, days always come before month and year. This has to do with the structure of how dates are formed in Russian. When referring to a specific day of a month, the day is in ordinal form, which in Russian acts like an adjective. That is, it declines like adjectives do. The day is in prepositional case followed by the specific month. Because we are indicating a day of a specific month, the month is in genitive case, as it is the possessor of the day. Finally, while in English we can refer to the year 2021 as "twenty twenty-one", in Russian this is not possible. Years are always referred to in full numeral form. So, in English it would be "two thousand twenty first year" and the Russian translation would be "две тысячи двадцать первого года." In Russian, when referring to the year, the numeral form of it will always be followed by the russian word for year, "год." So, if we wanted to put all these ideas together to give a Russian date, as we do in our project, then March 31st, 1997 would be input would be 31.03.1997 and the Russian translation would be "тридцать первое марта тысяча девятьсот девяносто седьмого года."
